# nexmonaut

A lil friendly CLI to interact with Nexmo.

## Setup

### Clone the repo to your machine and download dependencies

```
$ git clone https://github.com/phazonoverload/nexmonaut
$ cd nexmonaut
$ npm install
$ npm link (this makes the nexmonaut command available in your terminal)
```

### Setup a new application

1. Generate a new application in the [Nexmo dashboard](https://dashboard.nexmo.com/messages/create-application)
2. You'll need to set up a seperate application to handle webhooks that Nexmo sends to update you on message status and incoming messages. More on this below.
3. You should keep your `private.key` safe as this won't be regenerated by Nexmo. We recommend putting it in a `~/nexmo` directory, but you can put it anywhere you like.
4. Take note of your application ID - you'll need it.

#### Webhook server

Nexmo sends a webhook to tell you when there's an incoming message, or to update you about a message's status. [You can learn more about webhooks in context of Nexmo here.](https://developer.nexmo.com/concepts/guides/webhooks)

To keep this demo simple, I've set up an [application running on Glitch](https://glitch.com/~nexmonaut) which will always respond with a 200 (OK) status. You may want to execute some application logic at this point, but we're just responding with a status as required. 

* In the Status URL box you can put `https://nexmonaut.glitch.me/webhooks/message-status`
* In the Inbound URL box you can put `https://nexmonaut.glitch.me/webhooks/inbound-message`

### Optional: set your environment variables

Your Nexmo API Key and Secret are used across your account, so I recommend storing them as environment variables. Doing this permenantly is different absed on which shell you use, but to do it temporarily you can type the following:

```
export NEXMO_API_KEY=<KEY>
export NEXMO_API_SECRET=<SECRET>
```

If you set these, nexmonaut will automatically use them. If not, it will prompt you for your API Key and Secret when using a command.

# Usage

## `nexmonaut balance`

![GIF showing the command nexmonaut balance returning â‚¬11.60](/docs/balance.gif)

If your NEXMO_API_KEY or NEXMO_API_SECRET environment variables aren't set, you will be prompted for them.

## `nexmonaut sms`

If your NEXMO_API_KEY or NEXMO_API_SECRET environment variables aren't set, you will be prompted for them.

Don't prepend phone numbers with a + or 00 - for a UK number the format should be something like `447496012345`
